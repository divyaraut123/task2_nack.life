                        <h2>Information </h2>
                        <p>Few activities can match the simplicity and universality of running. It's a sport that requires no fancy equipment, no extravagant playgrounds, just a pair of sturdy, reliable shoes and the open road ahead.

                            For many, this long but joyful journey starts humbly, often as a hobby. The initial strides may feel unfamiliar, and the road ahead may seem long and daunting. But with each passing day, and with consistent baby steps, beginners become regulars, and regulars become enthusiasts - the transformative power of running begins to reveal itself. It instils not just physical strength but mental endurance, teaching valuable lessons about perseverance, consistency and fortitude.
                            
                            Whether one runs for leisure, competition, or the sheer joy of movement, most runners have a strong community that transcends differences, backs them up and shows up for them in more ways than one!
                            
                            We had the pleasure of speaking with some established runners in our community to share some tips for beginner runners.
                            
                            Nivedita Samanta
                            Running & Performance Coach - FitRabbits & Adidas Runners India
                            running coach
                            
                            Nivedita is a 10x marathoner, the Performance Coach for Adidas Runners in India & part of the global Adidas Runners women’s squad. A certified Marathon Running Coach, and an EXOS Performance Specialist, she started her coaching venture - FitRabbits in 2017 to inspire others to discover their fittest self.
                            
                            She believes that understanding the uniqueness and needs of each body, especially considering hormonal cycles for women, is a pivotal aspect of one’s running journey. She encourages setting long-term goals, while breaking them down into achievable monthly and three-month milestones. “For specific aspirations, seeking professional guidance ensures a focused and effective approach to success.”
                            
                            “For beginners embarking on their running journey, I recommend a well-structured and realistic plan. Allocating three days a week for 30-45 minutes of jogging and walking, with thoughtful breaks incorporated, lays the foundation for steady progress. Dynamic warm-ups and cool-downs on running days, along with 2 days of strength training play a crucial part in building strength and ensuring injury prevention. Striking a balance between joy and challenge is essential.”
                            
                            Beyond the physical aspects, Nivedita underscores the significance of mental well-being. She encourages runners to embrace a wholesome approach, nurturing a positive mindset throughout their journey. As a final ingredient for peak performance, Nivedita shares insights on diet, emphasising the importance of protein intake. “A balanced calorie intake split in a 45:35:20 ratio of protein:carbs:fats works well for me. Having protein-rich options like moong salads, cheela, plant protein or whey supplements spread throughout the day, aids in recovery, strength building, and weight management. Of course, everyone’s needs are different, so figure out what works best for you, and seek professional advice whenever needed!”, says Nivedita.
